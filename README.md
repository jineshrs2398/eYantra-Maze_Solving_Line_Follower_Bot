# eYantra: Maze Solving Line Follower Bot
This repository contains the codes and videos of a Maze Solving Line Follower Robot we built as a part of the e-Yantra 2018 Competition conducted by IIT Bombay, along with the simulations done on V-Rep. The arena consists of elevated terrains and we also built a lift mehanism to enable the bot to climb up & down the elevated terrain autonomously.

**Note: The Codes and Videos of each task can be found in the individual Task folders, in this root directory.**
